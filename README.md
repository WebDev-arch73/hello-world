# hello-world
I am learning
I am just following the tutorial. I still do not have a clear idea of what this git hub does or the absolute necessity of having it. What if I could send the issue by email to someone else or submit a question on a forum? Couldn't that be just the same? What if you don't want to share the one of a kind idea with everyone?
